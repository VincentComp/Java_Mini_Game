     * A Function to perform BFS for the shortest path between Tom and Jerry.
     * It takes in a map, the current position of Tom, current position of jerry as an input
     * It uses a queue to store the ready discovering vertex and use a 2D array to reccord the discovered note.
     *
     * The queue is initialed with the current position of the Tom
     * The neighbour positions(within boundary and clear vertex) of Tom is added to the queue as the first generation of the seraching vertices.
     * Each is initialized with its relative direction associated with Tom's direction, which will be passed to the next generation
     * Then, the (n+1)th generation seraching vertices will be generated after the searching of nth generation vertices are completed
     *
     * This process is repeated until the current vertex of Jerry is serached.
     * As a result, the direction toward the shortest path will be returned as the class Direction
